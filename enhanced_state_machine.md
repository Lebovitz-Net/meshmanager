# Refined State Machine (with ACK Awareness)

## Here’s how you might evolve your state machine:

```js
const SOCKET_STATES = {
  IDLE: 'idle',
  CONNECTING: 'connecting',
  OPEN: 'open',
  REQUESTING: 'requesting',
  AWAITING_ACK: 'awaiting_ack',
  WAITING: 'waiting', // for non-ACK replies
  CLOSING: 'closing',
  CLOSED: 'closed',
  ERROR: 'error',
  RETRY_WAIT: 'retry_wait'
};
```

### ransition Flow with ACK

| Trigger               | From → To                      | Notes                                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `sendRequest()`      | `OPEN → REQUESTING`             | Begin request                        |
| `requestSent`        | `REQUESTING → AWAITING_ACK`     | ACK required to proceed              |
| `ackReceived`        | `AWAITING_ACK → WAITING` or `OPEN` | Proceed or await full reply       |
| `replyReceived`      | `WAITING → OPEN`                | Ready for next                       |
| `timeout / no ack`   | `AWAITING_ACK → ERROR` or `RETRY_WAIT` | Retry or fail                  |
| `socket.onclose(1013)` | `ANY → CLOSING → CLOSED`       | Teardown chain                       |

### Implementation Tips

* Tag requests with requiresAck: true so your state machine knows to enter AWAITING_ACK.

* Gate downstream flows (e.g. UI updates, telemetry subscriptions) until ACK is received.

* Timeout logic should be stricter for ACKs—missing one could mean stale or invalid state.

* Teardown logic on 1013 should cancel any pending ACK waits to avoid ghost retries.

### Bonus: ACK Tracker

You could scaffold a useAckTracker() hook that:

* Tracks pending ACKs by requestId

* Logs latency and success/failure

* Cancels downstream flows if ACK isn’t received in time

* Would you like help scaffolding that next? It would make your mesh bridge resilient to silent failures and teachable for future contributors.

## Example Code for hardening the state machine

Socket Lifecycle Hardening (State Machine Version)

1. Centralize Connection State
Replace individual flags with a single socketState:

```js
const SOCKET_STATES = {
  IDLE: 'idle',
  CONNECTING: 'connecting',
  OPEN: 'open',
  REQUESTING: 'requesting',
  AWAITING_ACK: 'awaiting_ack',
  WAITING: 'waiting',
  CLOSING: 'closing',
  CLOSED: 'closed',
  ERROR: 'error',
  RETRY_WAIT: 'retry_wait'
};

const [socketState, setSocketState] = useState(SOCKET_STATES.IDLE);
const [lastCloseCode, setLastCloseCode] = useState(null);
```

This lets you gate all downstream flows based on explicit lifecycle transitions.

2. Handle 1013 Explicitly
```js
socket.onclose = (event) => {
  setLastCloseCode(event.code);

  if (event.code === 1013) {
    console.warn('Socket closed with 1013: Try Again Later');
    setSocketState(SOCKET_STATES.CLOSING);
    teardownSocketChain();
  } else {
    setSocketState(SOCKET_STATES.CLOSED);
  }
};
```

3. Teardown the Entire Chain

```js
function teardownSocketChain() {
  socketRef.current = null;
  setSocketState(SOCKET_STATES.CLOSED);
  cancelPendingRequests(); // your own logic
  clearListeners();
}
```

4. Gate All Requests

Replace this:

```js
if (!isConnected || isClosing || lastCloseCode === 1013) {
  console.warn('Request blocked due to socket state');
  return;
}
```

With this:

```js
if (
  socketState !== SOCKET_STATES.OPEN &&
  socketState !== SOCKET_STATES.REQUESTING &&
  socketState !== SOCKET_STATES.AWAITING_ACK
) {
  console.warn('Request blocked: socket not in valid state');
  return;
}
```

### Optional Enhancements

* Tag each request with a sessionId to trace lifecycle context.

* Log race-prone flows like reconnect + retry loops, especially if async.

* Use the full state machine to model transitions: idle → connecting → open → requesting → awaiting_ack → waiting → closing → closed → retry_wait
