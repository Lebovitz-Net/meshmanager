# 🤝 Contributing to KD1MU Mesh Dashboard

We welcome contributions that improve clarity, modularity, and protocol fidelity. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new handler, or improving onboarding docs, your input helps make this system more resilient and teachable.

## 🧠 Philosophy

This project is built for maintainability and onboarding ease. Please annotate your code, follow folder conventions, and keep diagnostic overlays modular.

   ```

4. **Make your changes**
   - Add new handlers to `bridge/handlers/`

## 📚 Style Guide

- Use consistent naming (`getNodeInfo.js`, `insertMetrics.js`)
- Annotate modules for onboarding clarity
- Keep packet decoding transport-agnostic
- Separate `user_info` and `metrics` cleanly

## 🧪 Testing

- Dry-run packet types using `packetDecoder.js`
- Validate schema with `core/schema.js`
- Emit UI refresh via `websocketEmitter.js`
