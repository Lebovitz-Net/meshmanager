#  WebSocket Tagging Scheme for Connection Lifecycle Debugging

## Overview

When debugging WebSocket lifecycle issues ‚Äî such as ‚Äúsocket not open‚Äù errors ‚Äî it‚Äôs often hard to tell whether a send failed because the connection never opened, or because it opened and then closed before the send.  
A **tagging scheme** lets you track each connection cycle as a distinct state machine instance, making it easy to correlate events and disambiguate failure modes.

---

## Motivation

- **Identify lifecycle races**: See exactly when a connection opened, closed, and when sends occurred.
- **Disambiguate failure modes**: Distinguish ‚Äúnever opened‚Äù from ‚Äúopened then closed‚Äù.
- **Correlate logs**: Tie all events to a unique connection tag for easier tracing.
- **Hardware‚Äëstyle debugging**: Similar to tagging cycles in embedded systems to track state transitions.

## üõ† Implementation Steps

1. Generate a Unique `connectionTag` per `connect()` Call

Increment a counter or use a timestamp each time you initiate a connection.

```js
let connectionCounter = 0;
const currentTagRef = useRef(null);

function connect() {
  const tag = ++connectionCounter;
  currentTagRef.current = tag;
  wasOpenedRef.current = false;
  console.log(`[TAG ${tag}] CONNECT CALLED`);

  const ws = new WebSocket(url);
  socketRef.current = ws;

  ws.onopen = () => {
    console.log(`[TAG ${tag}] OPEN`);
    wasOpenedRef.current = true;
    updateStatus('open');
  };

  ws.onclose = (evt) => {
    console.log(`[TAG ${tag}] CLOSE code=${evt.code} reason=${evt.reason}`);
    updateStatus('closed');
  };

  ws.onerror = (err) => {
    console.error(`[TAG ${tag}] ERROR`, err);
  };
}
```

2. Track wasOpened Per Tag
Use a wasOpenedRef to remember if this connection ever reached OPEN.

```js
const wasOpenedRef = useRef(false);
Reset to false in connect().

Set to true in onopen.

3. Gate send() with readyState and wasOpened
js
function send(data) {
  const tag = currentTagRef.current;
  const ready = socketRef.current?.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN;

  if (ready) {
    console.log(`[TAG ${tag}] SEND`, data);
    socketRef.current.send(data);
  } else {
    if (wasOpenedRef.current) {
      console.warn(`[TAG ${tag}] SEND FAILED ‚Äî socket was open earlier, now closed`);
    } else {
      console.warn(`[TAG ${tag}] SEND FAILED ‚Äî socket never opened`);
    }
  }
}
```

4. Log All Lifecycle Events with Tags
Every onopen, onclose, onerror, and send() log should include the current tag. This makes it trivial to follow a single connection‚Äôs lifecycle in logs, even if multiple connects happen over time.

## Benefits

Clear history per connection: Know exactly what happened in each cycle.

Better root cause analysis: Quickly see if a send failed due to premature close or handshake never completing.

Improved observability: Logs become self‚Äëdocumenting.

Low overhead: Minimal code changes, big debugging payoff.

## Optional Enhancements

Expose cycleId downstream: Pass the current tag to other hooks/components so they can correlate their own logs.

Timestamp events: Include Date.now() in logs for timing analysis.

Integrate with send queue: Combine tagging with a queued send mechanism to avoid lost packets entirely.

##  Summary

By tagging each WebSocket connection cycle and tracking whether it ever reached OPEN, you gain the same kind of visibility hardware engineers use when debugging state machines. This approach makes it far easier to diagnose ‚Äúsocket not open‚Äù errors and other lifecycle races in complex client‚Äëside networking code.
