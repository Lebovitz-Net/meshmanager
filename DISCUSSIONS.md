# 🧠 MeshManager v2 — Runtime Config & Transport Architecture (Session Summary)

## ✅ Goals Covered
- Bootstrapped WebSocket, MQTT, and TCP transport layers
- Integrated Express server for runtime config API
- Clarified TCP port usage and cultural context
- Scoped `.env` vs `config.js` responsibilities
- Discussed persistence and frontend wiring for tomorrow

---

## 🧱 `server.js` Architecture

```js
import express from 'express';
import { config } from './config.js';
import runtimeConfigRoutes from './routes/runtimeConfigRoutes.js';
import createWebsocketSessionHandler from './handlers/websocketSessionHandler.js';
import createMQTTHandler from './bridge/mqttHandler.js';
import createTCPHandler from './bridge/tcpHandler.js';
import { routePacket } from './core/ingestionRouter.js';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use('/api/v1/config', runtimeConfigRoutes);

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('MeshManager v2 is running'));
app.listen(config.http.port, () => {
  console.log(`🛠 Express server listening on port ${config.http.port}`);
});

createWebsocketSessionHandler({ port: config.websocket.port });

const mqttHandler = createMQTTHandler('mqtt-bridge', {
  brokerUrl: config.mqtt.brokerUrl,
  subTopic: config.mqtt.subTopic,
  pubOptions: config.mqtt.pubOptions
});
mqttHandler.connect();

createTCPHandler('tcp-bridge', config.tcp.host, config.tcp.port, {
  onConnect: (id) => console.log(`[TCP ${id}] Connected`),
  onFrame: (id, frame) => routePacket(frame, { source: 'tcp', connId: id }),
  onError: (id, err) => console.error(`[TCP ${id}] Error:`, err.message),
  onClose: (id) => console.warn(`[TCP ${id}] Closed`)
});
```

---

## ⚙️ `config.js` Strategy

```js
export const currentIPHost = '192.168.1.52';
export const currentIPPort = 4403;
let currentIP = `${currentIPHost}:${currentIPPort}`;

export const getNodeIP = () => currentIP;
export const setNodeIP = (ip) => { currentIP = ip; };
```

- Defaults are hardcoded for clarity and onboarding
- No `.env` override for device IP—keeps discovery logic clean
- Runtime mutability via `setNodeIP()` for UI integration

---

## 🔌 TCP Port 1337

- Used for incoming TCP frames from mesh nodes or simulators
- Routed via `routePacket()` into ingestion pipeline
- Symbolic port often used in dev environments (“leet” culture)

---

## 🧭 Express Middleware

- `express.json()` is built-in since v4.16.0
- Enables parsing of JSON POST bodies
- No need to generate or install separately

---

## 🗂️ Next Steps (Deferred to Tomorrow)

- Scaffold `ConnectionPanel.jsx` to hit `/api/v1/config/node-ip`
- Add `config.json` fallback for persistence across restarts
- Annotate `config.js` and `runtimeConfigRoutes.js` for onboarding clarity
- Optionally emit diagnostic events for UI overlays

---

## 📝 Notes

- Chat saved manually as `.txt` due to session/account mismatch
- Express is installed and working
- Chat history won’t persist across reboot—manual save confirmed

---

## 🧠 Reminder for Tomorrow

To resume:

> “Let’s pick up the runtime config API work—IP setting via UI.”

I’ll be ready to scaffold the frontend, wire up the POST route, and optionally persist config state.

## 🛠 Refactor: Unified Insert Handlers & Updated Ingestion Router

### Summary
We removed the old split between `insertUserInfo.js` and `insertMetrics.js` and consolidated **all database write functions** into a single file:  
`src/bridge/db/insertHandlers.js`.

The ingestion pipeline (`ingestionRouter.js`) was updated to import from this unified file, eliminating duplicate imports and making all DB writes easy to find and maintain.

---

### Changes Made
1. **Created `insertHandlers.js`**
   - Merged all insert functions from `insertUserInfo.js` and `insertMetrics.js`:
     - `insertNode`
     - `insertChannel`
     - `insertMessage`
     - `insertConnection`
     - `insertPacketLog`
     - `insertTelemetry`
     - `insertEventEmission`
   - Ensured function names match exactly what the ingestion router calls.
   - Standardized signatures: each insert accepts a plain object with the required fields.
   - Used `INSERT OR REPLACE` where appropriate to avoid duplicate primary key errors.
   - Defaulted timestamps to `Date.now()` if not provided.

2. **Updated `ingestionRouter.js`**
   - Single import from `insertHandlers.js` instead of two separate files.
   - Captured a single `ts` timestamp per packet for consistency across inserts.
   - Added guards to prevent inserting orphaned records without required foreign keys.
   - Preserved existing logic:
     - Decoding via `decodeAndNormalize`
     - Delegating `FromRadio` frames to `routeFromRadio`
     - Broadcasting decoded packets to WebSocket clients

3. **Removed legacy files**
   - `insertUserInfo.js` and `insertMetrics.js` are no longer needed.
   - Any other modules that imported from them should now import from `insertHandlers.js`.

---

### Benefits
- **Single source of truth** for all DB writes.
- **Simpler ingestion imports** — one file, all inserts.
- **Easier onboarding** — contributors can find all write logic in one place.
- **Consistent timestamps** for all inserts from the same packet.
- **Future‑proof** — adding a new insert type only requires updating one file.

---

### Next Steps
- Audit other parts of the codebase for direct imports from the old insert files and update them.
- Consider adding transactions for high‑volume telemetry inserts to improve performance.
- Document the insert function contracts in `CONTRIBUTING.md` for future contributors.

🔗 Integration Steps
Normalize MeshPacket decoding

✅ You’ve got decodeMeshPacket returning { type, data, meta }.

Ensure all portnums (1, 3, 4, 7, 67) are covered and return consistent shapes.

Wire into dispatchSubPacket

If subPacket.type === 'meshPacket', unwrap with decodeMeshPacket.

Pass normalized { type, data, meta } into dispatchRegistry.

Expand dispatchRegistry

Map normalized types to handlers:

message → insertMessage

position → insertPosition

nodeInfo → upsertNodeInfo

telemetry → insertMetricsHandler

adminMessage → (placeholder / ignore for now)

Unify insertHandlers surface

Ensure insertHandlers.js re‑exports everything, including insertMetricsHandler.

That way, dispatch only ever imports from insertHandlers.

Schema validation

Run decoded payloads through schemaValidator.js before inserts.

This catches malformed packets early and prevents DB corruption.

Diagnostic logging

Keep getKnownOneofs in dispatchSubPacket for unhandled oneofs.

Add a similar log for unknown MeshPacket portnums.

This gives you live coverage metrics while testing.

End‑to‑end test

Feed in a fixture for each portnum (1, 3, 4, 7, 67).

Confirm: decode → dispatch → insert → DB row created.

Log overlays/events to verify observability.

📘 Suggested Next Move
Start by wiring telemetry (port 67) through the full chain, since you already have insertMetricsHandler and all the group inserts. That’s the most complex path, and once it works, the others (message, position, nodeInfo) will feel straightforward.
